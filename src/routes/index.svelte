    <h1>Build The Community Your Fans Will Love</h1>

    <p>
      Huddle re-imagines the way we build communities. You have a voice, but so does your audience. Create connections
      with your users as you engage in genuine discussion.

    <h2>Grow Together</h2>
    <p>
      Generate meaningful discussions with your audience and build a strong, loyal community. Think of the insightful
      conversations you miss out on with a feedback form.
    </p>

    <h2>Flowing Conversations</h2>
    <p>
      You wouldn't paginate a conversation in real life, so why do it online? Our threads have just-in-time loading for
      a more natural flow.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Users</h2>
    <p>
      It takes no time at all to integrate Huddle with your app's authentication solution. This means, once signed in to
      your app, your users can start chatting immediately.
